    \begin{enumerate}
        \item In this assignment we worked on implementing virtualization in  our toy OS: xv6.
        \item Container Manager and functionalities have been implemented in the kernal mode.
    \end{enumerate}
    We implemented container related services to obtain virtualisation in our OS. Various global and local data structures, w.r.t container, were introduced to achieve this: \\
    
\hspace*{-1cm} \textbf{Container table:}
\lstinputlisting[language=C]{struct1.c}
\begin{itemize}
    \item It is a global struct, which maintains all the allocated and available containers
    \item "allocated" array keeps track of empty and allocated containers.
\end{itemize}

\lstinputlisting[language=C]{f4.c}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Inside the \code{proc} struct a new variable \code{container\_id} is added which stores in which container this process lies.(Contains $0$ if process is not in any container)
\end{itemize}
